# Ask My Mentor - Menotor Q&A Platform 

A full-stack web platform that connects users with mentors by allowing them to ask questions and receive responses via an automated email and database-driven workflow. 
Built as a real-world startup-style MVP with focus on speed, scalability, and clean system design.

## Why this project ?
- Most students and early professionals don’t have direct access to mentors ( also they are afraid to ask questions directly )
- Nowadays most of the seniors of faang and maang are charging money from students/juniors to help them
- Good conversation btw seniors and juniors is become more of a buisness or side income source
---
Ask My Mentor bridges this gap by creating a simple, fast, and automated system where:
- Users can submit questions to mentors
- Mentors receive them instantly via email
- Responses are tracked and delivered back to users
Basically this project simulates how real SaaS products handle user requests, email automation, and database persistence at scale.
